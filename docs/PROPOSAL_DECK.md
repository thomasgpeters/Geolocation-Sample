## Proposal Presentation

---

## Slide 1: The Problem

### Franchise Sales Teams Waste 40% of Their Time Finding Leads

**Current State:**
- Manual searches across Google, Yelp, LinkedIn, and directories
- No systematic way to identify businesses likely to need services
- Duplicate data entry across CRM and spreadsheets
- Missed opportunities due to incomplete market coverage

**The Cost:**
| Metric | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| Hours per week on manual research | 15-20 hrs |
| Lead quality from manual search | ~20% qualified |
| Market coverage | <30% of potential prospects |
| Cost per qualified lead | $45-75 |

> *"Our reps spend more time searching than selling."*
> — Regional Franchise Director
